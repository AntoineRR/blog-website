title: Europython 2022 - My take on the event
mathjax: false
---

The 2022 edition of Europython took place in Dublin from 11th to 15th July, and I had the opportunity to spend the whole week at the event. This was very interesting, I learned a lot of things and met many people there. I decided to write this blog post to sum up the most interesting things I learned from this event as a reminder for me and to create a place for gathering ideas.

I struggled to find a way to organize all the things I learned from this week of conferences. In the end, I decided to divide everything I learned into categories, and write a section for each, with a reference to the conferences I used to write each section.

# Security

Talks:
- CPython bugs & risky features *by [disconnect3D](https://disconnect3d.pl/about/)*
- Writing secure code in Python *by [Yan Orestes](https://twitter.com/yyyyyyyan_)*

Python is secure most of the time, and if we compare it to C++, there is less work to do as a developer to write secure code. However, we should still be careful how we use Python as bad practices can be problematic.

## The python interpreter

Some of you probably use the python interpreter pretty often by just running the `python` command. This opens an interactive prompt where you can write and execute python code one line at a time. [disconnect3D](https://disconnect3d.pl/about/) showed during his talk that this command may lead to security issues. Indeed, the program will try to fetch some dependencies in the directory where you launched the command, and if one of these dependencies was replaced by a malicious one, the code will be executed. This can be an issue if, as a sysadmin, you open a python interpreter in a folder where users upload files for example. The issue seems to be fixed in python 3.11, but for earlier versions of python, it is probably a good idea to alias the `python` command to `python -I` to remove this risky behavior.

## General advices

When developing in Python, some mistakes can lead to security vulnerabilities. [Yan Orestes](https://twitter.com/yyyyyyyan_) made us aware of the potential security concerns we should have as software engineers:
- The `eval()` method is not secure and shouldn't be used (especially with an external input), as there is always a way around it.
- When loading a data serialized with [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html), the dunder method `__reduce__()` is called on the serialized object. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if we are not careful. An alternative is to use a safer serialization format such as `json`.
- `pip` is the most widely used package manager for Python developers. To install a package, pip will first look for a binary, then try to build the package from source, and finally if none of the previous methods worked, it will run the `setup.py` file. This is were things can turn wrong, as any code can be written in this file. Some malicious packages used this method combined with name squatting (the package has a name similar to a widely used package, e.g.: `reqeust` instead of `request`) to hack into computers. This can be prevented with the `--only-binary` and `--require-hashes` flags when running `pip install`.
- CVEs are discovered all the time. It is common for packages to fix some of them in new releases, so keep your packages up to date.
- Python as a whole should also be updated to avoid reaching the end of life for a release. Some functions may also be marked as `deprecated` and thus shouldn't be used anymore.
- Randomness is a difficult subject in computer science, and Python's random module is not the best at generating random numbers. Alternatives are the `secrets` module, `os.urandom()` and `random.SystemRandom`.
- Extracting `.tar.gz` files can be dangerous, and an inspection of the file should be done before extracting it.
- `assert` is not equivalent to an `if` statement! Indeed `assert` also checks the value of the `__debug__` boolean which is set to `False` when running `python` with the `-O` flag.

Finally, some code audition tools are available: [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/), [Horusec](https://horusec.io/site/), [Pyre/Pysa](https://pyre-check.org/), [Coverity scan](https://scan.coverity.com/), [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)

Some interesting tools to use with Python were presented. I compiled the one I found the more useful below.

## Hypothesis

[Hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis) is a testing library that automates the choice of parameters to test your functions. Check the following example:

{% highlight python %}
@given(
    st.one_of(
        st.lists(st.integers(), min_size=1),
        st.lists(st.floats(allow_nan=False), min_size=1),
    )
)
def test_max_returns_max(values):
    assert max(values) == sorted(values)[-1]
{% endhighlight %}

This method will be tested with 100 different inputs, those inputs being either a list of integers or a list of floats. Then, the max function is tested against the last element of the sorted list to check if it indeed returns the maximum value of the list. With Hypothesis, if you are creative enough in your assert statements, you can write testing methods that will cover much more inputs than if you did it manually. Hypothesis also tends to often test edge cases (empty lists, `None` values, etc).

## Poetry

Also most people use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) as their package manager for Python, there are alternatives that are more recent, complete and secure. One of them is [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), and it was introduced in several talks during Europython. Here is a summary comparing pip to poetry.

|                                           | pip | poetry        |
| ----------------------------------------- | --- | ------------- |
| Beginner friendly                         | Yes | Yes           |
| Heavily relies on other tools             | Yes | No            |
| Built-in virtualenv management            | No  | Yes           |
| Python 2 support                          | Yes | Dropping soon |
| Manage package and distribution by itself | No  | Yes           |

Poetry has a number of advantages over pip, and I won't go in depth on this subject here. Check out the [poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/) for more information.

## Code checks

Many tools exists in Python for checking the quality of your code. Here are the most used ones:
- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) - Autoformat your Python files.
- [Isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) - Automatically sort your import statements.
- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) - Get hints about bad code practices, this can be extended with your own lints.
- [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) - Check the type hints in your project.

All those tools can be run locally using a git [precommit hook](https://pre-commit.com/) for example. However, some checks may take to much time to run them in a precommit hook, such as `mypy`. A good practice is to use all those tools in a CI pipeline on your repository (for example using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)).

If you didn't use those tools from the beginning of your project and you have a huge codebase to refactor, you may want to automate the refactor. This is possible if you create a script that apply those tools on a few files, then automatically opens a pull request on your favorite code hosting platform. Gitlab and Github do provide API that will let you do this with a script. Then, a reviewer can be assigned to manually check if the changes are correct.

You may also want to check the performances of your Python code. For this purpose, they are multiple tools depending on your needs:
- [pytest-profiling](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-profiling/): this tool displays a heat graph for your program.
- [pyspy](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy): An tool that is external to your project and adds a very low overhead to your program execution as it runs in a separate process.
- [Opentelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/): An instrumentation tool to highlight the performances of distributed systems.

## Robyn

[Robyn](https://github.com/sansyrox/robyn) is an async web framework for Python with a Rust runtime. It is currently the only async web framework for Python, and also the fastest framework. It also supports sync methods, and its syntax is very similar to [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/), but there are some key differences between the two. The project is currently under active development and didn't reach a stable 1.0 version for now.
