A startpage that gives a peaceful feeling, built with Vue.js.

`Vue.js`{:.info} `Web`{:.info}

I came across a very interesting subreddit called [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/) one day, and I always thought I should try to build one for myself. When I finally found some time for it, I decided to use the Vue framework because Vue is suited for small projects like this, and I wanted to get back to it.

With this project, I was also able to build a continuous deployment pipeline so that each time I push my code online, it is automatically built and [deployed on GitHub pages](https://antoinerr.github.io/peaceful-startpage/).
