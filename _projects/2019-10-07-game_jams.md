Two video games created with a team during two 48 hours long events (Utopiales Game Jam and Global Game Jam). I was in charge of the programming part, using Unity and Unreal Engine.

The first video game is called **Super Infectoid Turbo** and was made in Nantes during the *Utopiales Game Jam* in 2019. This was an in-person event where I met developers, artists, and game designers to build a game in two days. The theme was "Virus", and we decided to make a game where you play as a virus infecting cells.

The second video game is called **Lost and Bitos**, and I did it during the *Global Game Jam* of 2021, entirely remotely. Our team was huge for a jam (11 persons) and it was a challenge to be organized. The theme was "Lost and Found", and we decided to create a game that is similar to a 3D "Where's Waldo?" video game.
