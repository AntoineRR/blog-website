A Unity asset to resize, rotate, and translate 2D sprites during runtime in Unity. It is published for free on Unity's official asset store.

During my work on a Unity project, I wanted to find an asset to interact with 2D objects during runtime. I found some assets that were really not designed for 2D, but nothing that could help me have an easy interaction with sprites. This is why I decided to create my own asset for moving, rotating and scaling objects. This was an interesting challenge, and the first time I published my code on an official platform.

This asset is downloadable for free on Unity's asset store: [Runtime 2D transform interactor](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/runtime-2d-transform-interactor-175502)
